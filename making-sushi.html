			<h1>Making Sushi</h1>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>In order to make a fine japanese sushi roll (or nigiri) you don't need years of experience cutting raw fish and rolling rice rolls. It is not as difficult as most people may believe. Just follow the following instructions and you can make your own sushi at home today!
				<br></br>
				<b>Things You will need when making sushi:</b>
				<li>A bamboo mat</li>
				<li>Nori (Seaweed)</li>
				<li>Sushi rice</li>
				<li>Fillings (Such as fish, vegetables, etc)</li>

			<h2>Step 1: Placing the Nori</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>Feel the nori sheet from both sides and you will find one side to be a bit smooth and the other a little rough. The nori should lay on the rolling mat with the rough side facing upwards.</p>

			<h2>Step 2: Getting the Rice Ready</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>Get your hands wet, and make about a handful of rice to a ball of rice. It's important to keep your hands wet while working with sushi rice because it is sticky. When you work with the nori though, you should keep them as dry as you can. That is why you should have a bowl of water (with a bit of rice vinegar added to it) and a dry hand-towel nearby when making sushi.</p>

			<h2>Step 3: Spreading</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>Gently put the rice ball in the middle of the nori sheet, and start spreading it equally on the nori, creating a layer of rice covering almost the entire sheet except the upper margin of about 2 cm that should be kept uncovered. Later on, the margins need to be empty of rice in order to close to sushi roll properly. Be careful not to compress the rice, but merely spread it over the nori.</p>

			<h2>Step 4: Filling the Sushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>Now it's time to place a slice of fish (preferably no more than one) on the edge of the nori, along with 1-3 pre-cut slices of vegetables (carrot, cucumber, green onion, asparagus, etc.)</p>

			<h2>Step 5: Rolling the Sushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>Using the closer edge of the rolling mat, close on the filling with the nori making a rectangular shaped hill and tighten it from above. Move forward, continue rolling in the rectangular hill steps, keeping it tight with every move until you reach the end of the nori. Put pressure on the roll from all three sides at all time, especially on stops to allow it to roll tightly.</p>

		<h2>Step 6: Cutting the Sushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut the roll in to little sushi units. 6-8 units per roll - that's your call.</p>
