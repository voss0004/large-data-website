##Final Decision

I have decided to choose style tile 2 as my website design inspiration. I chose this style tile because it is a generic design that I believe will attract the most viewers. It is a clean, professional and structured look that will easily allow the viewers to search throughout the website. My main goal is to have a website that users do not feel threatened by and this style tile will help me acheive this goal.
