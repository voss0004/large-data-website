			<h1>About Sushi</h1>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>Sushi is characterized by a slightly sweet, sticky rice, made with a sweet vinegar and rice combination, usually lined with seaweed or kelp, called nori, and then the ingredients are placed in the center and the rice and seaweed are wrapped around the ingredients into a cylindrical roll. Once the sushi is rolled, it can be cut into the familiar circles served in restaurants and stores. Raw meat (usually but not necessarily seafood) sliced and served by itself is sashimi. Many non-Japanese use the terms sashimi and sushi interchangeably, but they are not synonymous. Sushi refers to any dish made with vinegared rice.</p>

			<h2>History of Sushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>The origin of sushi is believed to have been during the second century A.D. in Southeast Asia because of the need to keep meat fresh without refrigeration. They would cure meat and fish and wrap it in rice to preserve its freshness. It was then left to ferment for several months. If the meat and fish were treated this way, it could be preserved for several months longer than being cured alone. Eventually, when enough time had passed, they would discard the rice and eat the cured insides.

<br>The idea eventually spread through China and then to Japan, where fish is a food staple. The Japanese would ferment their cured-fish-and-rice sushi with Japanese rice wine, or sake.
About ten centuries later, people started adding vinegar to their sushi to aid in the fermentation process. This way, they didn't have to wait so many months for the sushi to be ready.
In the 1820's, chefs started using raw fish in their sushi, known as Edo-style sushi. This is the style you will find in most sushi restaurants.</br></p>
