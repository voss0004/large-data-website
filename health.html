			<h2>Nutrition</h2>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>The main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, as are gari and nori. Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have a variety of health benefits.</p>

			<h2>Health Risks</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>Some of the ingredients in <em>sushi</em> can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of <em>methylmercury</em>, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups including women who might get pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children.<br></br>

<em>Sashimi</em> or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:

<li>Clonorchis sinensis a fluke which can cause clonorchiasis</li>
<li>Anisakis, a roundworm which can cause anisakiasis</li>
<li>Diphyllobothrium, a tapeworm which can cause diphyllobothriasis</li>
<br></br>
For the above reasons, the EU regulations forbids the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours. As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers and end users <em>super freeze</em> fish for sushi to temperatures as low at −60°C. As well as parasite destruction, super freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh thus preventing the discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20°C.
Some forms of sushi, notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Particularly, fugu consumption can be fatal - a few deaths occur in Japan every year from eating fugu fish sushi. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan. The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test, preparing and eating the fish. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass. The Emperor of Japan is forbidden to eat fugu, as it is considered too risky.</p>
