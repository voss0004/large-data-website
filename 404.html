			<h2>While You're Here... Read Some Facts About Sushi!</h2>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<ul>
<li>The word “sushi” refers to rice that has been seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt, and contrary to popular belief, Sushi does not mean raw fish at all.</li> 

<li>Raw fish sliced and served by itself is sashimi.</li> 

<li>Sushi is really just Japanese "fast food" consisting of cooked rice combined with other ingredients, most commonly seafood. </li>

<li>Good sushi rice is somewhat chewy, and sticky to the touch. </li>

<li>Sushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, in one or two bites, although many customers use chopsticks.</li>

<li>Please do not pass food from one person to another using chopsticks, as this parallels a Japanese funeral ceremony. It is more appropriate to use the blunt end of your chopsticks and pass the food from one plate to the next. </li>

<li>Sushi-grade fish that is suitable for eating raw must be frozen for seven days at negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit, or flash frozen for 15 hours at negative 31 degrees. </li>

<li>Fish that's "fresh out of the ocean" is often dangerous to eat. </li>

<li>The Food and Drug Administration stipulates that all fish to be eaten raw (with the exception of tuna) must be frozen first, in order to kill parasites. </li>

<li>Japanese usually eat miso soup not at the beginning of the meal, but at the end—to aid digestion. </li>

<li>The knives used by sushi chefs are the direct descendants of samurai swords, and the blades should be sharpened every day. </li>
