**Makizushi** (巻き寿司, *rolled sushi*), **Norimaki** (海苔巻き, Nori roll) or **Makimono** (巻物, variety of rolls) is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat. *Makizushi* is generally wrapped in *nori* (seaweed) and filled with a variety of different vegetables and fish. Usually they contain 1-4 different vegetables or fish. *Makizushi* is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order.

Common types of makizushi:

- **Futomaki** (太巻, *thick, large or fat rolls*) is a large cylindrical piece, with nori on the outside. They are often made with two - four fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. *Futomaki* is typically vegetarian. 

- **Hosomaki** (細巻, *thin rolls*) is a small cylindrical piece, with the nori on the outside. They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, thinly sliced carrots, or avocado.

- **Temaki** (手巻, *hand roll*) is a large cone-shaped piece of nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical *temaki* is about four inches wide before rolled.

- **Uramaki** (裏巻, *inside-out roll*) is a medium-sized cylindrical piece with two or more fillings. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots.
