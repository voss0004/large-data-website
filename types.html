			<h1>Types of Sushi</h1>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>The common ingredient across all kinds of sushi is vinegared sushi rice. Variety arises from fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation. Traditional versus contemporary methods of assembly may create very different results from very similar ingredients. In spelling sushi, its first letter s is replaced with z when a prefix is attached, as in nigirizushi, due to consonant mutation called rendaku in Japanese.</p>

		<h2>Chirashizushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p><em>Chirashizushi</em> is a bowl of sushi rice topped with a variety of sashimi and garnishes (also refers to barazushi). Edomae chirashizushi (Edo-style scattered sushi) is an uncooked ingredient that is arranged artfully on top of the sushi rice in a bowl. Gomokuzushi (Kansai-style sushi) consists of cooked or uncooked ingredients mixed in the body of rice in a bowl. There is no set formula for the ingredients; they are either chef's choice or specified by the customer. It is commonly eaten because it is filling, fast and easy to make. Chirashizushi often varies regionally. It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March.</p>

			<h2>Inarizushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p><em>Inarizushi</em> is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone. It is named after the Shinto god Inari, who is believed to have a fondness for fried tofu. The pouch is normally fashioned as deep-fried tofu. Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette . It should not be confused with inari maki, which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu. A version of inarizushi that includes green beans, carrots, and gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular aburage (fried tofu) piece, is a Hawaiian specialty, where it is called cone sushi and is often sold in okazu-ya (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.</p>

			<h2>Narezushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p><em>Narezushi</em> (matured sushi) is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this sushi can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more. The most famous variety of narezushi still being produced is funa-zushi, a typical dish of Shiga Prefecture.</p>

			<h2>Nigirizushi</h2>

When ordered separately, nigiri is generally served in pairs.</p>

			<h2>Western Style Sushi</h2>
			<div class="paragraph grid-background">
				<p>The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan (a notable exception to this is the use of salmon which was introduced by the Norwegians in the early 1980s). Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll. A wide variety of popular rolls has evolved since. Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include:
				<ul>
				<li> <strong>Alaska roll:</strong> a variant of the California roll with raw salmon on the inside, or layered on the outside.</li>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>British Columbia roll:</strong> contains grilled or barbecued salmon skin, cucumber, sweet sauce, sometimes with roe.</li>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>California roll:</strong> consists of avocado, imitation crab/crab stick, cucumber and tobiko, often made with rice on the outside.</li>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Dynamite roll:</strong> includes yellowtail and/or prawn tempura, and fillings such as bean sprouts, carrots, avocado, cucumber, chili, spicy mayonnaise, and roe.</li>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Hawaiian roll:</strong> contains shoyu tuna, tamago, kanpyō, kamaboko, and the distinctive red and green hana ebi (shrimp powder).</li>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Philadelphia roll:</strong> consists of raw or smoked salmon, cream cheese (often Philadelphia cream cheese brand), cucumber or avocado, and/or onion.</li>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Rainbow roll:</strong> is a California roll with typically 6–7 types of sashimi (yellowtail, tuna, salmon, snapper, white fish, eel, etc.) and avocado wrapped around it.</li>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Seattle roll:</strong> consists of cucumber, avocado, cream cheese and raw or smoked salmon.		</li>
				<li> <strong>Mango roll:</strong> includes fillings such as avocado, crab meat, tempura shrimp, mango slices, and topped off with a creamy mango paste.
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Spider roll:</strong> includes fried soft-shell crab and other fillings such as cucumber, avocado, daikon sprouts or lettuce, roe, and sometimes spicy mayonnaise.
				</li>
				
				</ul>
